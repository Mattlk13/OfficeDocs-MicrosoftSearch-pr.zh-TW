# Integrate PowerApps

Help your users complete tasks, such as entering vacation time or reporting expenses by integrating existing PowerApps into your bookmarks. Integrated PowerApps appear within a bookmark result, eliminating the need to go to a different site or open a separate tool, which saves times and effort.
  
## What are PowerApps?

PowerApps is a service that lets you build business apps that run in a browser or on a phone or tablet with no coding experience required. Learn more:

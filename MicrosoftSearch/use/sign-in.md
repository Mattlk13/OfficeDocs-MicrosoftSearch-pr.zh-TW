# Sign in to Microsoft Search

Once your IT department has added you as a Microsoft Search user, sign in with your work or school account.
  
## Sign in to Microsoft Search

If you're already signed in to an Office 365 application, you'll be automatically signed in to Microsoft Search when you go to Bing. If you're not signed in:
  
1. In the upper-right corner of any Bing page, click **Sign in** or **Sign in to see business results**
    
2. If you don't see these sign-in options, go to [Explore Microsoft Search](https://www.bing.com/business/explore)
    
    You'll be automatically redirected to your organization's sign-in page.
    
3. On the account menu, next to **Work or school account**, click **Connect**
    
4. If prompted, choose the account you want to sign in with or enter your email address and password
    
## Use a browser extension to sign in automatically

If you use Chrome on Windows 10, install the Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension. With it you can sign in to supported sites like Microsoft Search and Office 365 without having to enter your email address and password.
  
## Sign out of Microsoft Search

- In the upper-right corner of any Bing page, click your name, then, on the account menu, next to **Work or school account**, click **Sign out**.
    
Bing saves your work or school account status, either signed in or signed out, in a browser cookie. If you sign out and clear your cookies, the next time you go to Bing you may be automatically signed in, or you may be prompted to sign in again. Your IT department configures this for your organization.
  
When you're signed in to Microsoft Search, some features, like personalized results and Microsoft Rewards, may behave differently or be unavailable.

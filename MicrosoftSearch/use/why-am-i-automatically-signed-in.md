# Why am I automatically signed in?

To help you find the information you need quickly and easily, your organization is configured to sign you in to Microsoft Search automatically.
  
## About Microsoft Search

Microsoft Search brings the content you need from your school or workplace into Bing. Learn more [About Microsoft Search](about-microsoft-search.md).
  
## Privacy and security

With Microsoft Search, only people you've granted access to will see your shared files. Other results like org charts and people information will only appear to others in your organization.
  
Microsoft Search helps protect your privacy by safeguarding your search history. Your search history isn't shared with other people in your organization, even when you are signed in and search for work- or school-related information.
  
To improve your search experience, Bing reports frequent searches made by multiple users to your organization's administrators. Only administrators can view this data, it's not linked to specific users, and only appears when multiple users have searched for the same thing.
  
Every organization is different, and Microsoft can't guarantee how yours handles your searches and other data outside of Microsoft Search.
  
## Sign out of Microsoft Search

You can sign out of Bing at any time: in the upper-right corner of any Bing page, click on your profile, and click **Sign out**.
  
You won't be signed in automatically again on this device. If you've used other browsers or devices to sign in to Microsoft Search, you'll need to sign out there as well. 
  
When you're signed out, your searches won't receive additional protection. They're treated as standard Bing consumer searches and are governed by the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).
  
## View your search history

To see your Microsoft Search history for the past 30 days, go to your [search history](https://ssl.bing.com/profile/history), and under Microsoft Search in Bing, click **Export**. Searches older than 30 days are automatically cleared from your history.

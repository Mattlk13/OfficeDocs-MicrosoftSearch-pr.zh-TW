# Find conversations

Search for your own private Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Yammer conversations or conversations between co-workers that you have access to.
  
Conversation results include:
  
- The name of person who sent it
    
- If it's a Teams or Yammer conversation
    
- A snippet of the message
    
- The conversation date
    
- Attachments that you have access to
    
The top 30 conversation results appear in work results. For more information or results, just click the message. In work results, Yammer conversations are sorted by date, but in the Yammer client, they're sort by relevancy.
  
You won't see conversation results if your organization doesn't use Teams or Yammer or your IT department doesn't turn on these results.
  
1. Sign in to your work or school account on Bing
    
2. Search for a topic or a person's name and click the **Conversations** tab 
    
    For example, 'send me the deck' or 'Amy Turner.'
    
3. Conversations appear at the top of the results page
    
    Other web results appear under it. They aren't specific to your organization.

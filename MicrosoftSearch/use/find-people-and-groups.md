# Find people and groups

It's easy to find information about your co-workers using Microsoft Search. Just search on Bing for their name or alias to find contact info, upcoming meetings you have together, org chart details, group memberships, and files they've shared with you.

## Find people

Your IT department determines the content that appears in Microsoft Search results.
  
1. Sign in to your work or school account on Bing
    
2. Search for 'me,' your name or work alias, or a co-worker's name or alias
    
    Including both a first and last name will return the best result, but, if you only know part of their name, Microsoft Search will show you the result that best matches your search and, if possible, offer to show more results.
    
3. A people card appears at the top of the results page or at the top of the right column
    
    Check out the details and actions on the card and click through for even more information.
    
Web results appear under your work results. These results aren't specific to your organization. In some cases, for example, when a name is a very common web search, the people card may not automatically appear. To see your work results you may need to click the **Show results from** link next to your organization's logo. 
  
## Find groups

Just like you search for yourself or a co-worker, enter the name of a group or group alias to see contact details, group owners, members, files they've shared with you, and conversations.

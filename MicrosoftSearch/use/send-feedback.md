# Send feedback

Your feedback helps make Microsoft Search better. In a work result, use the Feedback link to comment on what you like, don't like, or suggest new features or results you want added. You can also use the link to report any issues or problems you experience.
  
## Send feedback about work results

To send feedback, at the bottom of any work result, click **Feedback**. Depending on the type of result, you may see options to send feedback to your IT department or to Microsoft.
  
Feedback you send to Microsoft is posted in our UserVoice widget. Anyone sending feedback may be able to read and subscribe to your comments.
  
Feedback you send to your IT department isn't shared directly with Microsoft.
  
## Send feedback about web results

As you use Microsoft Search, you may have feedback about the web results you see. To send feedback about them, click **Feedback** at the bottom of any Bing page. This feedback isn't shared with your organization. Bing reviews all feedback, but you won't receive a personal response.

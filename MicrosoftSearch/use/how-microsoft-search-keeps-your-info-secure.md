# How Microsoft Search keeps your info secure

Microsoft Search uses several methods to secure your content and information:
  
- Microsoft Search results come directly from the same Trusted Cloud used by Office 365. Bing does not store any work content or information in the public web index.
    
- You can only see work results when you're signed in with your work or school account.
    
- Microsoft Search will only return information you have permission to see. You may have permission because you created the files or information, they've been shared with you or with a larger group that includes you, or they're stored in folders or locations you have permission to access.
    
- Microsoft Search doesn't use your work searches to improve public web results or to improve Bing.
    
- Microsoft Search doesn't let advertisers target you or anyone within your organization.

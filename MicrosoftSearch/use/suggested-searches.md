# Suggested searches

The first time you sign in to Bing with your work or school account, you'll see a welcome message at the top of the page with suggested searches. These searches are designed to help familiarize you with Microsoft Search and the types of work results you'll find when you search.
  
To make them more relevant to you and other people in your organization, your IT department has reviewed them or created their own.
  
Occasionally, you'll see messages announcing new features or telling you more about Microsoft Search. We'll always give you a link to learn more or you can go to [Explore Microsoft Search](https://www.bing.com/business/explore) for more information.

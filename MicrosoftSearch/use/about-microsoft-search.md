# About Microsoft Search

Microsoft Search effortlessly brings searching work and the web together in one experience. Use Microsoft Search for a simple, fast, powerful, and safer way to get the right information at the right time in any browser and on any device.
  
Whether you're searching for people, files, org charts, internal sites and resources, or answers to common questions, you can use Microsoft Search throughout your work day to get answers faster, be more productive, and work smarter. To get work results, just go to [bing.com/business](https://www.bing.com/business), sign in with your work or school account, and search.

Microsoft Search will only return information and files that you have permission to see. You may have permission because you created the files or information, they've been shared with you or with a larger group that includes you, or they're stored in folders or locations that you have permission to access.

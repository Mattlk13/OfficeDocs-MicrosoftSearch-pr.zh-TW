# Admin portal tools

The Microsoft Search Admin portal includes tools and resources designed for admins, editors, and users, including:
  
- Content creator browser extension
    
    Available for admins and editors, use the Chrome or Edge extension to easily [create bookmarks](create-bookmarks.md) and [Q&As](create-qas.md) simply by going to a site or page. 
    
- Microsoft Search in Bing search extension
    
    Available for authorized users, use the Chrome or Edge extension to quickly access Microsoft Search enterprise search without leaving the page or site you're on.
    
- Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome
    
    Available for authorized users, use the Chrome extension to easily authenticate with Azure Active Directory when signing in to supported sites, including Office 365 and Bing. We recommend deploying this extension when you [test single sign-on](test-single-sign-on.md).
    
- Import top SharePoint queries as bookmarks
    
    Available to admins, use this PowerShell script to [import SharePoint top queries](import-sharepoint-promoted-results-and-top-queries.md) as draft bookmarks. Download the script and open the README file for information about requirements, examples, and available parameters. 
    
- Import SharePoint Promoted Result Query Rules as bookmarks
    
    Available to admins, [import SharePoint promoted results](import-sharepoint-promoted-results-and-top-queries.md) and top queries, or Best Bets, as suggested bookmarks.

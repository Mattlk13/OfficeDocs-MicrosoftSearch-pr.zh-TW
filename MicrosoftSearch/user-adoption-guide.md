# User adoption guide

This information is intended for Microsoft Search admins, change management leaders, and business owners.
  
To roll out and ensure the successful adoption of Microsoft Searc across your organization, we recommend this four-stage process.
  
## Stage 1: Stakeholders

To ensure a seamless rollout and increase user adoption of Microsoft Search, identify people who can help support and drive the process.

## Stage 2: Scenarios

To ensure user adoption, it's critical to determine and define end-user scenarios. These should include real-world examples of how people can use Microsoft Search to find the information they need, answer questions, and complete tasks faster. In order to measure the success of your roll out and user adoption, it's also important to determine the metrics you'll use before you begin.
  
 **Understand what your users need and want**
  
When it comes to finding information and getting answers, knowing your user's needs and pain points is key. You can use quantitative methods, like data from Office 365 and SharePoint search usage, or qualitative methods, like surveys and user focus groups to get this data. This will help you determine when, where, and how Microsoft Search can provide value.
  
For various roles and teams across your organization, consider:
  
- Existing user pain points when searching for information.
    
- Frequently used apps, tools, sites, and other information sources.
    
- What users would like to see when it comes to searching for information.
    
- How the benefits of Microsoft Search apply to your organization. For more information see [Why Microsoft Search](why-microsoft-search.md).
    
Choose the user scenarios that will have the biggest positive impact for your users.
  
 **Identify success metrics**
  
To help you meet your roll-out goals and show a positive impact for your organization, it's critical to determine your key success metrics before you start. Keep your goals simple and measurable and assess performance on a regular basis so you can respond quickly if needed.
  
1. **Change management:** Determine how you'll measure awareness of Microsoft Search and the success of communications about it. 
    
2. **Usage:** You can leverage data from your Insights Dashboard including daily and monthly active users (DAU and MAU), the content types that are getting the most views, and top search keywords to measure usage over time. For more information, see [Use the Insights Dashboard](get-insights.md).
    
3. **User satisfaction:** Use the data you gathered from surveys and user focus groups to determine your baseline. Net satisfaction (NSAT) and Net Promoter Scores (NPS) can also provide helpful measurements. Regardless of the method you use, keep it consistent so you can see impact over time. 
    
4. **Other measurements:** Use historical and/or current data for support requests and the amount of time spent searching. 
    
## Stage 3: Readiness

Investing time in preparing for your Microsoft Search rollout will result in a positive impact for your organization. 
  
 **Product and content readiness**
  
Administrators directly influence the search experience for end users and determine how Microsoft Search looks for the organization. This includes choosing the types of results you want to surface to your users. Control this by turning on or off results for documents, sites, people, groups, or conversations.
  
For more information, see [Set up Microsoft Search](set-up-microsoft-search.md).
  
Editors are subject matter experts who help manage Bookmarks and Q&As within their areas of expertise. Editors should create content that addresses the user scenarios that you identified earlier.
  
For more information, see [Plan your content](plan-your-content.md).
  
 **Signing in**
  
Microsoft Search users must sign in to Bing with a work or school account. To make signing in as seamless as possible for your users:
  
- Ensure Azure Active directory configurations are correctly set, have a few users try to sign in. For more information, see [Test single sign-on](test-single-sign-on.md).
    
- Set browser defaults for company-managed devices to Bing. For more information, see [Set default browser](set-default-browser.md).
    
- Deploy search extensions for Edge and Chrome users via Group Policy. For more information, see [Admin portal tools](admin-portal-tools.md).
    
 **Draft communications**
  
Use your real-world scenarios to tell users about Microsoft Search and how it will help them save time. Your change management team can help create a rollout strategy and prepare collateral and campaigns for end-user readiness.
  
Begin planning communications and events for your organization:
  
- Banners, posters, or leaflets placed in prominent locations
    
- In-person product demos or booths
    
- Online events for local and remote teams
    
- Have your executive sponsor host a town hall meeting or send an announcement email
    
- Share self-help documentation about using Microsoft Search
    
All communications should educate users about how they can sign in to Bing to find work results.
  
 **Engage partner teams**
  
As an integral part of Microsoft 365, Microsoft Search complies with GDPR and Tier-C guidelines. Depending on your organization, it may be necessary to share information about Microsoft Search with your privacy and security teams. For more information, see [Security for Microsoft Search](security.md).
  
Make sure your help desk knows about the features and functionality of Microsoft Search, as well as the user requirements to sign in, so they can more effectively support users. For more information, see [Use Microsoft Search](use/about-microsoft-search.md) and [FAQs](faqs.md).
  
 **Evaluate with pilot users**
  
Start with a small group of users to evaluate the impact of Microsoft Search and gather early feedback. This gives you time to change content, update your communications, and set expectations for the broad rollout. Search power users or early adopters are great candidates for this.
  
To help find pilot users:
  
- Partner with a business sponsor within your organization
    
- Identify a group of early adopters
    
- Identify groups that do high volumes of enterprise searches
    
- Identify users in other geographical locations, including international
    
Ask your pilot users to provide input using the feedback options in Microsoft Search or via simple surveys.
  
Survey questions to ask: 
  
- Do you understand how to sign in and use Microsoft Search?
    
- Does it work as expected?
    
- Which features do you like?
    
- Were you able to find work results?
    
- Were the work results helpful?
    
- Are the communications about Microsoft Search clear and understandable?
    
This is a great time to begin measuring the effectiveness of the metrics identified in Stage 2.
  
When you start the pilot phase, consider sharing a sneak peek of Microsoft Search with the wider organization.
  
## Stage 4: Roll out

Every organization thinks about product rollouts differently. Here are a few things to consider.
  
 **Broad deployment**
  
When you are ready, either allow all users in your organization access to Microsoft Search, or use a phased approach to roll out more slowly. 
  
 **Generate awareness**
  
Build excitement in your organization about Microsoft Search:
  
- Enlist pilot users to provide peer-to-peer assistance and expertise.
    
- Follow through on the communications and events you planned in Stage 3.
    
 **Ongoing communication**
  
For the first few weeks and months, maintain a rhythm of communications to encourage engagement with Microsoft Search. This keeps users informed and engages new users. Each communication should explain why Microsoft Search can be helpful to their work.
  
Send ongoing communications that highlight features and searches to try, as well as user success stories.
  
 **Gather feedback and improve**
  
Support users and let them know you care by listening to them and acting on their feedback.
  
Use the insights dashboard to see how the product and the content is performing. Leverage this information to update bookmarks, Q&As, and other communications. This will also help you:
  
1. Improve the content quality: review titles, descriptions, and URLs, optimize keywords, remove obsolete information, and add new information
    
2. Determine which features are most frequently—or infrequently—used
    
3. Conduct surveys, focus groups, and feedback sessions to understand what users think of Microsoft Search, increase adoption, and identify improvement areas
    
Education and feedback is an iterative process. It may be necessary to make changes to content and communications as your users adopt Microsoft Search.

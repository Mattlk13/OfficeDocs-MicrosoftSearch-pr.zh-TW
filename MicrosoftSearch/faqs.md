# FAQs

These are the frequently asked questions that organizations and users have about administering and using Microsoft Search.
  
## What's the value proposition for Microsoft Search?

Microsoft Search is a secure way to search both your work and web content. This kind of integration across web and enterprise is only available with Microsoft. For compliance-related information, see [Security for Microsoft Search](security.md).

## Does Microsoft Search support advanced query understanding?

Yes, Microsoft Search parses query intent from larger phrases. This feature uses AI to learn common superfluous phrases users add to their queries that don't impact their search intent.

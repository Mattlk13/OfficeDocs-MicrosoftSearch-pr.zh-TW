# Test single sign-on

Single sign-on reduces the number of times users are prompted to sign in. Testing single sign-on with a small group of users will help identify any blocking configuration issues. 
  
For Chrome users on Windows 10, single sign-on will only work if the Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome is installed. 
  
## Download the Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome

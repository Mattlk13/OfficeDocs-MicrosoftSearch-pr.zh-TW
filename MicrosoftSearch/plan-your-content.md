# Plan your content

Before planning your content, understanding what you can add to Microsoft Search will be helpful:
  
- Bookmarks
    
    Quickly give users a link to an internal site, page, or tool where they can get additional information.
    
- Q&As
    
    Provide an answer or info to users including an optional link. Ideally, a Q&A includes all the details your users are looking for so they don't need to go to the source. You can format your Q&A content and include images, lists, and tables.
    
## Identify information your users need

Consider these ideas:
  
- [Import SharePoint promoted results and top queries](import-sharepoint-promoted-results-and-top-queries.md) as bookmarks 
    
- Use intranet search logs to determine sites and pages that get the most traffic
    
- Determine apps, sites, and tools that are used on a daily or weekly basis
    
- Gather information about key employee benefits and direct link to them
    
- Find policies and processes users need to be aware of
    
- Decide who and how users should contact support
    
- Get information that's needed on a recurring basis, either seasonally or based on business cycles
  
For example, people looking for tools to book time off or quarterly financial updates
    
- Collect policies for regional or mobile users like benefits that vary by location
    
- Determine internal sites and information for common web searches
  
For example, traffic, public transit information, local weather, discounts available from corporate partners, and health and fitness programs
    
- Find information about company-sponsored events, conferences, or retreats
    
- Research common IT, HR, and support issues and frequently asked questions and answers
    
## Build a support team

 **Leverage subject matter experts**
  
Build a support team that includes experts from HR, support, sales, and other key areas. To allow your SMEs to contribute content directly, add them as editors in the Admin portal. This also allows you to scale the amount of available content without needing additional staff resources.
  
 **Involve your users**
  
Involving users in the content creation process encourages them to use Microsoft Search. Ask them to use the feedback link in work results or the Edge or Chrome search extension to suggest bookmarks and Q&As. In addition to suggesting content, they can report errors, like broken or invalid links, and provide other feedback.
  
## Create high-quality content

 **Titles and descriptions**
  
People use bookmarks or Q&A titles and descriptions to determine if they address their search intent or if they need to try a different search. Titles and descriptions should reflect the core purpose of the result.
  
A good example of a title might be 'Childcare benefits,' with a description of 'Learn about benefits to help pay child care costs.' This informs users who search for 'childcare' that monetary support benefits are available and provides them a link to find out more.
  
Q&A titles should pose a question and the description should provide a short but useful answer. If there's additional information that would be helpful, link to it.
  
 **Keywords**
  
Keywords are the terms people in your organization search for on Bing to discover work results. Make your bookmarks and Q&As easier to find by including the right keywords. To identify these keywords, start by answering these questions:
  
- Which search terms are used to find the information you've identified?
    
    Leverage any existing taxonomy your organization uses, as well as related variations, acronyms, subjects, and topics.
    
- Which other variations or words do people use to talk about this information?
    
    Leverage your support team to determine these keywords.
    
For example, if you're creating a result that links to a tool for submitting vacation requests, keywords such as 'vacation' and 'submit vacation request' are good options to include. You may also find that people in your organization use 'holiday' or 'time off' to describe or search for vacation-related information. Adding keywords like 'holiday,' 'time off,' 'submit holiday request,' and 'request time off' as keywords makes the result easier for more of your users to discover.
  
 **Reserved keywords**
  
Microsoft Search determines which bookmarks appear as the top work results based on usage. When you need a specific result to appear as the top result, use reserved keywords. A reserved keyword is a unique word or phrase that identifies a bookmark or Q&A result. When a user enters a reserved keyword in the search box, that bookmark or Q&A will be the first result that appears. Use reserved keywords sparingly to allow Microsoft Search to learn based on usage.
  
 **Suggested keywords**
  
Create an initial set of keywords for a result by using automatic keyword suggestions. These suggestions are based on the title and URL for your bookmark or Q&A.
  
 **Group topics**
  
If you want users to find sets of related content when they search, try using the same keyword for all the bookmarks and Q&As about that topic. For example, if you're adding results about processes and tools around life status changes, you could include a keyword like 'marriage' to them to group together results about updating benefits, tax information, and name and alias changes.
  
## Test your content and search experience

After you've published results, it's important to verify:
  
- The correct bookmark or Q&A appears as the top result
    
- All related bookmarks or Q&As are relevant
    
- No unexpected results are included
    
- Result titles and descriptions provide the information and details your users are looking for
    
Your support team is a great resource to help test and validate the content and search experience.
  
## Review and update periodically

Maintaining the accuracy and freshness of your results is critical when you're providing authoritative information to your organization. Conduct periodic reviews to:
  
- Fix or remove broken or invalid URLs
    
- Remove content that's no longer relevant
    
- Update inaccurate or out of date titles and descriptions, including tool, site, or team name changes
    
- Review queries with low click-through rates and determine if the bookmark or Q&A content needs to be updated
    
- Review SharePoint Online and on-premises search queries, including popular or top queries, abandoned queries, and no queries to understand what users search for and where there are gaps
    
To quickly bulk edit your results, use the export and import features in the Admin portal.

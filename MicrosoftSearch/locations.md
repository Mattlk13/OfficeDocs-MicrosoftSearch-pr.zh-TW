# Locations

## Add locations

Locations help your users find addresses and locate your organization's buildings, offices, and other workspaces on a map. They can also use Bing Maps to get directions, see what's nearby, and more.
  
- [Add a location](add-a-location.md)
    
    Add a building, office, campus, or other workspace
    
- [Bulk create locations](bulk-create-locations.md)
    
    Add locations to a .csv file and bulk import them
    
## Manage locations

Use the location status, filtering tools, and bulk export/import tools to [find and update locations](manage-locations.md), including address and location name
  
## Location status

In the Admin portal, you can view locations by their current status:
  
- Published
    
    Published locations appear in Bing search results when an authorized user searches for a keyword.
    
- Draft
    
    If a location isn't ready to publish, save it as a draft. Draft locations will not appear on Bing.
    
- Scheduled
    
    Scheduled locations are automatically published on a future date.
    
- Expired
    
    Expired locations were automatically removed from published content based on their expiration dates.
    
- Suggested
    
    Suggested locations are based on feedback from users. You may also see default suggestions from Microsoft.

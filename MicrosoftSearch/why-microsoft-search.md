# Why Microsoft Search

Transform the way people in your organization search for information with Microsoft Search. 
  
This enterprise search experience increases productivity and saves time by delivering more relevant search results for the workplace. Microsoft Search securely retrieves information from your company, school, or organization—like files, company data, people info, and sites—as well as public web results, and displays them in a single experience.
  
## Save time with Intelligent Search

Microsoft Search leverages AI to provide contextual, boundless, and relevant results, to bring you the best search results from your organization and the web in a single experience.
  
## Get enterprise-grade protection

Microsoft Search requires Azure Active Directory authentication to access results from the Trusted Cloud. Authenticated users only see content they have access to. Search queries are de-identified and logs are separated from public Bing search traffic. This level of protection is unavailable anywhere else in the industry.
  
## Easy to administer and available everywhere

Deploying Microsoft Search is simple—just enable it from the Microsoft 365 admin center and customize settings, including your logo, name, color, and more. Authorized users can access it on any device just by signing in to Bing.
  
## One place to search across Office 365 apps

Microsoft Search brings together results from various data sources in Office 365, including SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, Teams, Yammer, Groups, and more. Finding relevant work results is as simple as a search.
  
## Share authoritative information and answer questions

Provide the information and answers your users need to complete tasks, like policies, benefits, resources, tools, and more in work results. You can also target specific groups, like new hires or remote workers.
  
## Find shared files

Microsoft Search uses advanced query understanding to make finding shared documents and files simple. Find documents you're collaborating on and files you have access to. 
  
## Complete tasks faster

Integrate PowerApps into your content to enable task completion within work results.
  
## Reduce support costs

Reduce costs and make users self-sufficient by embedding custom answers to common questions and minimizes the need for them to contact your help desk, IT department, or support team.

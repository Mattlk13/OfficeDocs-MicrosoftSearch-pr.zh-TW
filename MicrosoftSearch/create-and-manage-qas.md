# Create and manage Q&As

## Create Q&As

Q&As provide the best possible answer for your user's work-related questions. Users can easily discover them when they enter keywords you've associated with them on Bing.
  
- [Create Q&As](create-qas.md)
    
    Add individual Q&As.
    
- [Bulk create and import Q&As](bulk-create-qas.md)
    
    Create Q&As in a .csv file and bulk import them.
    
## Manage Q&As

Use the Q&A status, filtering tools, and bulk export/import tools to [find and update Q&A content](manage-qas.md), including title, answer, keywords, and URLs.
  
## Q&A status

In the Admin portal, you can view Q&As by their current status:
  
- Published
    
    Published Q&As appear in Bing search results when an authorized user searches for a keyword.
    
- Draft
    
    If a Q&A isn't ready to publish, save it as a draft. Draft Q&As will not appear on Bing.
    
- Scheduled
    
    Scheduled Q&As are automatically published on a future date.
    
- Expired
    
    Expired Q&As were automatically removed from published content based on the expiration date.
    
- Suggested
    
    Suggested Q&As are based on feedback from users.

# Manage bookmarks

Over time, you may need to update a bookmark's status and content to keep it relevant. 
  
## Filter bookmarks

3. To find a bookmark, search, filter, or click a bookmark status to narrow your results
    
4. To change or update a bookmark, click the title
    
5. Make any changes or updates to the content or settings and preview how they'll appear

# Add users

Enabling Microsoft Search for your entire organization or adding security groups, in addition to your IT department, are the quickest ways to add Microsoft Search users.
  
## Add admins and editors

1. Go to the Microsoft Search Admin portal
    
2. In the navigation pane, click **Users &amp; permissions**
    
3. At the top of the page, click **Add admin or editor**
    
4. In the **Additional admins** box, search for the people or groups you want to give admin permissions and select them from the results 
    
5. In the **Editors** box, search for the people or groups you want to give editor permissions and select them from the results 
    
6. Click **Save**
    
## Add users

By default, everyone in your organization has access to Microsoft Search work results. If you'd like to limit access to a smaller group, consider these options for identifying users:
  
- Partner with a business sponsor within your organization
    
- Identify a group of early adopters
    
- Identify groups that do high volumes of enterprise searches
    
- Identify users in other geographical locations, including international
    
To enable Microsoft Search for one or more users:
  
1. Go to the Microsoft Search Admin portal
    
2. In the navigation pane, click **Users &amp; permissions**
    
3. At the top of the page, click **Manage preview access**
    
4. Clear the **Add everyone in your organization** option 
    
5. In the **Only allow these users** box, search for the user or groups you want to add 
    
6. Click **Save**
    
Two hours after they're given preview access, users signing in with their work account on Bing will see relevant work results when they search. For information about signing in to Bing, see [Sign in to Microsoft Search](use/sign-in.md).

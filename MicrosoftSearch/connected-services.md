# Connected services

Microsoft Search lets you use the powerful Bing search engine to search your Office 365 organization's SharePoint files, bookmarked internal websites, people in the global address list, and Office 365 groups.
  
## Search for sites and documents

Search for sites, pages, files, and documents from SharePoint and OneDrive for Business. Browse files people have shared within your organization and within Office 365 Groups. For example, search for files like 'new employee training deck' or for a user and then, in the people result, just click on the files tab to see files they've shared. You can also search for SharePoint sites across teams and your organization.
  
Allow user access to SharePoint document and site search by turning on **Allow document and site search on Bing.com** in the Microsoft Search Admin portal. 
  
## Search for people

People search pulls in all the information about a person in your organization so you don't have to search in multiple places to get the full story. For example, if you search for 'Megan Fry,' you can see who she reports to, who she works with, her publicly shared files, her organization structure, and the groups she belongs to.
  
Allow user access to people search by turning on **Allow people search on Bing.com** in the Microsoft Search Admin portal. 
  
## Search for groups

Search for Office 365 groups to get information about the group, its owners, members, files, and conversations. If you click a conversation title, it'll open in Outlook on the web, and you can respond to or review it.
  
Allow user access to group search by turning on **Allow group search on Bing.com** in the Microsoft Search Admin portal. 
  
## Search for conversations

Search for your private Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Yammer conversations or conversations between co-workers that you have permission to view. For example, you can search for 'roadmap' and see the top 30 relevant conversations about it.
  
Allow user access to conversation search by turning on **Allow conversation search on Bing.com** for Microsoft Teams, Yammer, or both in the Microsoft Search Admin portal.

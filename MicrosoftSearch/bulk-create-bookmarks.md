# Bulk create bookmarks

Download and use the .csv template to bulk create, edit, and save bookmarks. To bulk edit existing bookmarks, export them from the Admin portal, make the necessary edits, and then import them.
  
1. In the upper-right corner of the Bookmarks section, click **Import**
    
2. Click **Download bookmarks template (.csv)**
    
3. Save and open the .csv file
    
4. Add the bookmark content and settings and save the file
    
5. In the upper-right corner of the Bookmarks section, click **Import**
    
6. In the Import bookmarks pane, click **Browse** and navigate to the .csv file you want to import 
    
7. Click **Import**
    
You'll get an error if any required data is missing or invalid. Depending on the error, a log file may be generated with more information about the rows and columns that need to be corrected. Make any necessary edits, and try importing the file again.
  
Note: Until all errors are resolved, you can't create or edit any bookmarks.
  
The fields in the import and export bookmark templates are the same. You can export, bulk edit, and import the edits, or start with an empty template to bulk create new bookmarks.
  
Not all fields are required and required fields vary depending on the bookmark state. Based on the state field, bookmarks will be saved as draft, suggested, scheduled, or they will be published automatically. Find out more about required and recommended fields in [create bookmarks](create-bookmarks.md).

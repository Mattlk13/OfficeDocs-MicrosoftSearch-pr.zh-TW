# Bulk create Q&As

Download and use the .csv template to bulk create or bulk edit Q&As. It's also a simple way to bulk save draft Q&As that need additional edits or updates. If you need to bulk edit existing Q&As, export them from the Admin portal, make the necessary edits, and then import them.
  
1. In the upper-right corner of the Q&As section, click **Import**
    
2. Click **Download Q&A template (.csv)**
    
3. Save and open the .csv file
    
4. Add the Q&A content and settings and save the file
    
5. In the upper-right corner of the Q&As section, click **Import**
    
6. In the Import Q&As pane, click **Browse** and navigate to the .csv file you want to import 
    
7. Click **Import**
    
You'll get an error if any required data is missing or invalid. Depending on the error, a log file may be generated with more information about the rows and columns that need to be corrected. Make any necessary edits, and try importing the file again.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Until all errors are resolved, you can't create or edit any Q&As. 
  
The fields in the import and export Q&A templates are the same. You can export, bulk edit, and import the edits, or start with an empty template to bulk create new Q&As.
  
Not all fields are required and required fields vary depending on the Q&A state. Based on the state field, Q&As will be saved as draft, suggested, scheduled, or they will be published automatically. Find out more about required and recommended fields in [create Q&As](create-qas.md).

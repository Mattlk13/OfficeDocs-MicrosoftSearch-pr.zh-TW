# Create and manage bookmarks

## Create bookmarks

Bookmarks help you promote the best possible results for your user's work-related queries. The more bookmarks you publish, the more value and benefit you add for users.
  
- [Create bookmarks](create-bookmarks.md)
    
    Add individual bookmarks.
    
- [Publish default bookmarks](publish-default-bookmarks.md)
    
    Review and add suggested bookmarks that address common searches.
    
- [Import SharePoint promoted results and top queries](import-sharepoint-promoted-results-and-top-queries.md)
    
    Leverage users' queries and existing Best Bet results to create suggested bookmarks.
    
- [Bulk create bookmarks](bulk-create-bookmarks.md)
    
    Create bookmarks in a .csv file and bulk import them.
    
- [Integrate PowerApps](integrate-powerapps.md)
    
    Add business apps to your bookmarks.
    
## Manage bookmarks

Use the bookmark status, filtering tools, and bulk export/import tools to [find and update bookmark content](manage-bookmarks.md), including title, keywords, and URLs.
  
## Bookmark status

In the Admin portal, you can view bookmarks by their current status:
  
- Published
    
    Published bookmarks appear in Bing search results when an authorized user searches for a keyword.
    
- Draft
    
    If a bookmark isn't ready to publish, save it as a draft. Draft bookmarks will not appear on Bing.
    
- Scheduled
    
    Scheduled bookmarks are automatically published on a future date.
    
- Expired
    
    Expired bookmarks were automatically removed from published content based on their expiration dates.
    
- Suggested
    
    Suggested bookmarks are based on feedback from users. You may also see default suggestions from Microsoft.
